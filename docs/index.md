## Welcome

This website contains Java source code related to the Moment Forest estimator from Nekipelov, Novosad, and Ryan (2020). Our goal is to  provide three sets of related source code:

1. Java source code of the core moment forest functionality, including bootstrapped standard errors, that works with moment-based objective functions. With minimal effort, researchers can modify these codes to use their own data sets and moment functions.
2. Java and Stata source code linking the moment forest estimator to Stata. This allows for an easy bridge between existing Stata data and the moment forest.
3. Worked examples of several common estimators, including randomized control trials (RCTs), regression discontinuity designs (RDDs), multiple outcomes, linear regression, and logit models.

This website is a work in progress but will be updated regularly as we push forward.
