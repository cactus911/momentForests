# Worked Examples of Moment Forests


<br>
## I. Data Generation Process
In order to show the overall performance of the algorithm, we proceeded with three simulations based on different types of parameters.

\\[
Y = X \beta + \epsilon
\\]
where (\epsilon) follows (N(0,1))
 1. discrete case: \\( \beta = x1 +10*(x2 -1) \\), where \\( x1, x2 = {1,..,10} \\)
 2. continuous case: \\( \beta = sin(x) \\), where \\( x = (0,2 \pi) \\)
 3. hybrid case: \\( \beta = sin(x1)*(x2 -5) \\), where \\( x1= (0,2 \pi) & x2 = {1,..,10} \\)
